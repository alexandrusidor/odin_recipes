    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!</p>
    <p>This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil</strong></li>
          <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.
             It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water),
             so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
        <li><strong>Brown the ground beef</strong></li>
          <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat.
              Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
        <li><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</strong></li>
          <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.
              Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
        <li><strong>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</strong></li>  
        <li><strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</strong></li> 
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna & Bake at 375 degress F for 40 minutes</strong></li>

    </ol>
